# Windows Self-Hosted Runner Setup

This machine builds and validates Ant Browser Windows releases. It replaces the
manual XiaoQ packaging loop with a repeatable GitHub Actions release path that
can compile, package, smoke-check, and publish Windows artifacts from a
controlled runner host.

## Runner Labels

Register the runner with all of these labels:

- `self-hosted`
- `windows`
- `ant-browser-release`

Release workflows should target:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, ant-browser-release]
```

## Required Tools

Install and verify these tools on the runner before registration:

- Git
- Go
- Node.js / npm
- Python 3
- Wails CLI
- NSIS / `makensis.exe`
- PowerShell
- GitHub Actions runner service

Recommended quick checks:

```powershell
git --version
go version
node --version
npm --version
python --version
wails version
makensis.exe /VERSION
pwsh --version
```

## Required Release Resources

The release runner must have the Windows fingerprint browser core available
outside the git worktree. Do not commit the browser core into this repository.

Recommended layout:

```powershell
C:\AntBrowserReleaseResources\chrome\<core-name>\chrome.exe
```

Register that path as a GitHub repository variable:

```text
ANT_BROWSER_WINDOWS_CHROME_ROOT=C:\AntBrowserReleaseResources\chrome
```

If `ANT_BROWSER_WINDOWS_CHROME_ROOT` is not set, the release script uses
`C:\AntBrowserReleaseResources\chrome` by default while running in GitHub
Actions.

The Windows release script treats GitHub Actions builds as if this flag is set:

```text
ANT_BROWSER_REQUIRE_WINDOWS_CHROME=1
```

With that gate enabled, packaging fails if no valid Windows `chrome.exe` is
found under `ANT_BROWSER_WINDOWS_CHROME_ROOT`. This prevents producing a green
release that cannot open managed 1688 shop windows with the packaged Ant
fingerprint core.

## Required Network Access

The runner must reach the internal server and static update host used by release
validation:

- `http://192.168.210.169:4174/api/health`
- `http://192.168.210.169:4174/api/client/health`
- `http://192.168.210.169:18080/healthz`

Preflight checks should fail fast when any endpoint is unreachable.

## Runner User

Use a dedicated Windows user for the GitHub Actions runner service. Do not reuse
a personal desktop account.

The runner user must be able to:

- Install Ant Browser to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ant Browser`
- Write Ant Browser runtime data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ant Browser`
- Write workspace agent state under `%ProgramData%\1688shop-agent`
- Stop stale release-test processes:
  - `ant-chrome.exe`
  - `xray.exe`
  - `sing-box.exe`

Grant only the permissions needed for packaging and release validation. Avoid
turning the runner into a general-purpose administrator workstation.

## Secrets

Never store Robbin's jump password on the runner, in GitHub Actions, or in this
repository.

Use a deploy-only SSH key for release upload or server-side release operations.
Store the connection details as GitHub Actions secrets:

- `WINDOWS_RELEASE_SSH_HOST`
- `WINDOWS_RELEASE_SSH_PORT`
- `WINDOWS_RELEASE_SSH_USER`
- `WINDOWS_RELEASE_SSH_KEY`

The private key should be scoped to release deployment only and should be
rotatable without affecting personal SSH access.

## Registration

Download the GitHub Actions runner package from GitHub, extract it into a stable
directory owned by the dedicated runner user, then register it with the release
labels:

```powershell
config.cmd --url <repo-url> --token <registration-token> --labels self-hosted,windows,ant-browser-release
```

Install and start the runner as a Windows service:

```powershell
svc install
svc start
```

After startup, confirm the runner appears online in GitHub with the labels
`self-hosted`, `windows`, and `ant-browser-release`.

## Local Preflight

Before enabling release workflows, run the local Windows release preflight from
the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\release\windows-release-preflight.ps1
```

The preflight should verify toolchain availability, internal endpoint access,
write permissions, and cleanup permissions for stale Ant Browser release-test
processes.
